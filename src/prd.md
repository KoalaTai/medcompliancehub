## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Professional confidence, intelligent oversight, proactive security
**Design Personality**: Clean, authoritative, modern, trustworthy, sophisticated
**Visual Metaphors**: Dashboard controls, shield protection, analytical insights, systematic organization
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean interface with progressive disclosure of complex functionality

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Professional corporate palette with accent highlights
**Primary Color**: Deep professional blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 230)) - trust and authority
**Secondary Colors**: Sage green (oklch(0.65 0.08 160)) - growth and balance
**Accent Color**: Warm amber (oklch(0.70 0.18 70)) - attention and energy
**Color Psychology**: Blue conveys trust and reliability, green suggests growth and compliance health, amber draws attention to critical actions
**Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
- Background (oklch(0.98 0.01 200)) with Foreground (oklch(0.25 0.08 230)) - 16.8:1 contrast
- Card (oklch(0.96 0.02 200)) with Card-foreground (oklch(0.25 0.08 230)) - 15.2:1 contrast
- Primary (oklch(0.45 0.15 230)) with Primary-foreground (oklch(0.98 0.01 200)) - 9.1:1 contrast

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter for all UI elements with JetBrains Mono for code/technical content
**Typographic Hierarchy**: 
- Headers: 700 weight, larger sizing for clear information hierarchy
- Body: 400 weight, optimized for readability
- Technical: Monospace for precise data display
**Font Personality**: Clean, modern, highly legible, professional
